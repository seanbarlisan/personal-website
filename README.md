# Personal Website

## Background

I created this website during my downtime at work and also when I was extremely bored of doing my other projects. I mindlessly programmed the website to use some basic. It has minimal features and is still a WIP, where I aim to streamline some features more efficiently such as the Spotify integration, dark mode and light mode support, and cleaner web design and animations.

### Core Technologies

* **CSS** - Website formatting
* **HTML** - Website formatting
* **TypeScript** - Website formatting
* **JavaScript** - Connection to API endpoints

### APIs

* **Spotify Web API** - This just communicates with Spotify to extract the "Recently Played" songs. I plan to demonstrate and showcase more later on.
